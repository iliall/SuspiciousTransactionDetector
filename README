File|Content
----|-------
historical_transaction|This file includes transaction data where each transaction is characterized by 100 variables. It also includes a target variable y that indicates whether a transaction is suspicious. This files will be used as the training dataset to develop the model that identifies suspicious transactions.
current_transaction.csv|Contains transaction data in the same format as historical_transaction.csv, but lacks the y column. The objective is to apply the trained model to this dataset to predict whether each transaction is suspicious.
predict.ipynb|A notebook that details the methodologies employed for model development including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
current_transaction_predictions.csv|This file contains the model's predictions for the y values (indicating suspicious or not) for each transaction in current_transaction.csv.
